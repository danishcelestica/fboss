# Meta FBOSS EEPROM Format v6

All Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) ID EEPROMs must follow the format below. This
replaces the Meta FBOSS EEPROM Format V5.

## Conventions

- All fields are **big endian**.
- String terminator `\0` is **not** included in the string field. The parser
  will determine the string size by reading the length field of TLV entries.

## Header

All Meta EEPROMs must start with the 4-byte header below. This header is
compatible with the past versions.

| Offset (byte) | Length (bytes) | Value  | Description                |
| :-----------: | :------------: | ------ | -------------------------- |
|       0       |       2        | 0xFBFB | Magic word                 |
|       2       |       1        | 0x6    | Meta EEPROM Format Version |
|       3       |       1        | 0XFF   | Reserved for future use    |

## Body

- The body must come after the 4-byte header.
- The body consists of the following well-defined Type-Length-Value (TLV)
  entries.
- There must not be any gap between the TLV entries.
- The `type` field is always **one byte**.
- The `length` field is always **one byte**. It contains the size of the
  corresponding `value` field. The value of the `length` field cannot be 0.
- The CRC field must be the **last entry**. The other TLV entries can be in any
  order.
- Each field can appear no more than once in the content.
- The below table only lists the Mandatory fields from the Meta software teams.
  Please check with Meta Manufacturing & Quality team to ensure other Mandatory
  fields are taken care of.

Used to uniquely identify platforms which have second-source or variance in hardware. This is not to be confused with EVT, DVT phase differences. For example, a SKU in MP might use voltage-regulators from two different vendors. But everything else (including other fields in EEPROM) will be the same across the two variants of the SKU. In this case, we assign a unique number in this field to uniquely identify the SKU with different voltage regulators. This field can be 0 if there are no respins or variants. |

## Checksum

We use the 16 bits CRC-CCITT-AUG specification with the following key
attributes:

- Width \= 16 bits
- Truncated polynomial \= 0x1021
- Initial value \= 0x1D0F
- Input data is NOT reflected
- Output CRC is NOT reflected
- No XOR is performed on the output CRC

All EEPROM content bytes (starting from Meta EEPROM header up to the CRC16 TLV,
but NOT including the CRC16 TLV field) are included for this CRC16 calculation.
Be aware there is a 16 bits argument for CRC16 calculation. For example, if
CRC16 Type field is located at offset 63, CRC16 calculation will include bytes
from offset 0 to offset 62, inclusively.

Check
[https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/fboss/platform/weutil/Crc16CcittAug.cpp](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/fboss/platform/weutil/Crc16CcittAug.cpp)
for CRC16 CCITT AUG implementation.

The below list shows the CRC16 output values for corner cases of byte streams
and can be used as the reference to check the correctness of the algorithm.

| Byte Stream                                                   | Length | CRC16 (per CRC-CCITT) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----- | :-------------------- |
| NULL                                                          | 0      | 0x1D0F                |
| A                                                             | 1      | 0x9479                |
| 123456789                                                     | 9      | 0xE5CC                |
| A string of 256 upper case “A” characters with no line breaks | 256    | 0XE938                |
